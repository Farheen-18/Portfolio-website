    <strong>Carbon footprint forecasting using Quantum RNN</strong><br/>
    <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Qiskit, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas<br/>
    <strong>Project Description:</strong> <br/>
    Developed a Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast carbon footprints using quantum computing techniques.<br/>
    The project involved data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of the quantum RNN's performance against classical models.<br/>
    The results demonstrated the potential of quantum computing in enhancing predictive accuracy for environmental data.<br/>

    <strong>Vehicle Parking System with Verilog Gatel level Verilog Modelling</strong><br/>
    <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Verilog, Quartus<br/>
    <strong>Project Description:</strong> <br/>
    Designed a vehicle parking system using Verilog at the gate level, simulating the parking logic and control mechanisms.<br/>
    The project included the development of a user interface for parking management and real-time monitoring of parking slots.<br/>
    The system was tested for efficiency and reliability in managing parking spaces in a simulated environment.<br/>
